        <h1 class="text-center">About Us</h1>
        <p class="mt-4">
           Welcome to the Predictive Factors for Depressive Behavior Machine Learning Project. Our initiative is dedicated to advancing the understanding and early detection of depressive behavior through the power of machine learning and data science.
        </p>
        <h2 class="mt-4">Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
           Our mission is to leverage cutting-edge technology to identify key predictive factors for depressive behavior. By analyzing a diverse range of mental health data, we aim to develop robust predictive models that can assist healthcare professionals in diagnosing and treating depression more effectively.
        </p>
        <h2 class="mt-4">What We Do</h2>
        <p>
            We work with comprehensive datasets that include various mental health conditions such as Schizophrenia disorders, Anxiety, Bipolar disorders, and Eating disorders. Our primary focus is on understanding how these conditions correlate with and potentially predict depressive behavior. By utilizing advanced machine learning algorithms, we strive to uncover patterns and insights that can lead to more accurate predictions and better mental health outcomes.
        <p>
           We invite you to join us on this important journey. Whether you are a researcher, a mental health professional, or someone passionate about mental health, there are many ways to get involved. Together, we can make a significant impact on the lives of those affected by depression. Thank you for your interest in the Predictive Factors for Depressive Behavior Machine Learning Project. Together, we can make a difference.
        </p>
